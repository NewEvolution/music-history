Branch for testing the initial change from just display: flex; to using flex-flow: row wrap; for page formatting, including adding the header bar to  the flexed area.

Works great on Chrome & Firefox, not so much on Safari and IE.

Now merged into master, with the previous layout branched as no_flex-flow.
